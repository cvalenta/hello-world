Learning how to use GitHub

I'm excited for what the future holds for me learning to code and becoming familiar with GitHub.

One goal I have is to make a partner program that makes creating a character in Pathfinder or Starfinder streamlined, be it a brand new level 1 character or even a level 20 character... if people want a mythic character (?) then eventually I'd like to add that as an option as well. 

I don't know why you'd be reading this but if you did anyway, thanks for reading! Let's change the world for the better!
